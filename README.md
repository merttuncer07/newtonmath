# newtonmath (slice 1: numbers)

A language only for mathematical computation. It is written in C with no dependencies. Build with `make`;
test with `make test`.

    ./newtonmath                    # line by line
    ./newtonmath file.nm            # run a file
    ./newtonmath -e "sqrt(2) to 30 places"

Every result carries its verdict:
- `[exact]`: the value itself.
- `[certified: sign change of ..., k places]`: a root whose bracket was confirmed by substituting both ends.
- `[bounded: k places guaranteed]`: ball arithmetic; the printed places are guaranteed.
- `error: ...`: the statement could not be carried out, with the reason.

Statements:
- `let r = root of y^3 - 2y - 5 = 0 near 2`, then `r to 50 places`. The second request continues from the first.
- Plain ASCII is canonical. `√ × · − ² ³` are accepted as aliases.
